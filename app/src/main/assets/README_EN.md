# 遇见手机助手 User Guide

Welcome to **遇见手机助手**! This is an intelligent agent application based on a multimodal large model that helps you automate various tasks on your phone.

## 1. Quick Start

### Step 1: Grant Necessary Permissions
When opening the app for the first time, the system will prompt you to grant the following two key permissions, which are essential for the app to function correctly:

*   **Overlay Permission**: Used to display the AI's running status and control panel over other apps.

Please click the prompt buttons inside the app (e.g., "Go to Enable", "Go to Grant") to jump to the system settings and turn on the corresponding switches.

### Step 2: Get and Configure API Key
This app is based on the Zhipu AI large model capabilities and requires an API Key to use.
